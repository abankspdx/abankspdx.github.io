## Hello!

My name is Alex Banks. I'm a software and data engineer in Portland Oregon! I've been working in software for about 10 years (but programming since ~2001) with a passion for data, analytics and cloud technology.

Currently I've worked as a Lead Data Engineer at FlowFi, a accounting and virtual CFO firm helping startups manage their money. Prior to that I worked in game analytics at Kongregate, and as a data/cloud engineer for wind energy.

### But what about outside of working?

Outside of dev work, I like to lift weights, play guitar and work on my house.
